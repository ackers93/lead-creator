## Technical Details

### API Integration

**Google Places API Endpoints Used:**
1. **Text Search** (`/place/textsearch/json`)
   - Searches for businesses based on query + location
   - Returns up to 20 results per search
   - Provides basic information

2. **Place Details** (`/place/details/json`)
   - Fetches detailed information for each selected business
   - Only called for businesses user wants to import
   - Provides phone, website, and other details

### Data Mapping

**From Google Places → Lead Model:**
```
business_name    ← name (required)
location         ← formatted_address
phone           ← formatted_phone_number
website         ← website
interest_level  ← "low" (default)
status          ← "interested" (default)
notes           ← "Imported from Google Places on [date]"
```

### Error Handling

The feature handles multiple error scenarios:

1. **Missing API Key**
   - Clear error message
   - Link to setup documentation

2. **No Results Found**
   - User-friendly message
   - Option to try a new search

3. **API Errors**
   - Catches HTTP errors
   - Catches API-specific errors (REQUEST_DENIED, etc.)
   - Displays helpful error messages

4. **Import Failures**
   - Counts successful vs failed imports
   - Shows first 3 error messages
   - Doesn't stop entire import if one fails

5. **Closed Businesses**
   - Automatically skips permanently closed businesses
   - Shows status badge for temporarily closed

### Performance Considerations

**Sequential Processing:**
- Place details are fetched one at a time
- Prevents API rate limiting issues
- Trades speed for reliability

**Typical Import Times:**
- 1 lead: ~1 second
- 10 leads: ~10 seconds
- 20 leads: ~20 seconds

**Session Storage:**
- Search parameters saved in session
- Allows returning to results after viewing lead details

## Features & Benefits

## Future Enhancements (Ideas)

### Short Term
- [ ] Cache recent searches to save API calls
- [ ] Add "Import All" button for power users
- [ ] Show business photos from Google
- [ ] Add business hours information
- [ ] Export results to CSV before importing

### Medium Term
- [ ] Batch import from CSV file
- [ ] Schedule automatic searches for new businesses
- [ ] Duplicate detection before import
- [ ] Category-based filtering of results
- [ ] Distance/radius-based search

### Long Term
- [ ] Integration with Google My Business for reviews
- [ ] Automated lead scoring based on business data
- [ ] Competitive analysis tools
- [ ] Territory mapping with imported leads
- [ ] CRM integration for enriching existing leads

## Security Considerations

✅ **API Key Protection**
- Stored in environment variable (not in code)
- Not exposed to client-side JavaScript
- Separate keys for dev/prod recommended

✅ **User Authentication**
- All routes require authenticated user
- Leads scoped to current user
- No cross-user data access

✅ **Input Validation**
- Query and location params validated
- SQL injection prevented by Rails
- XSS prevented by Rails ERB escaping

✅ **Rate Limiting**
- Sequential API calls prevent flooding
- Google's built-in rate limits respected
- Error handling for rate limit errors

## Cost Analysis

### Google Places API Pricing (as of 2024)

**Free Tier:**
- $200 credit per month
- Covers ~6,000 text searches
- Covers ~11,000 place details requests

**Typical Usage:**
- Small team (1-5 users): Well within free tier
- Medium team (10-20 users): Still likely within free tier
- Large team (50+ users): May need billing, but still affordable

**Cost Example:**
- Import 100 leads/month:
  - ~5 searches ($0.16)
  - ~100 details requests ($1.70)
  - **Total: ~$1.86/month**
